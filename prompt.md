PulseDev+ Implementation Blueprint




⸻




📊 Architecture Overview




Design Principles:
	•	Modular: Each major feature lives in its own package with independent testing.
	•	Local-First: All processing and storage are done locally unless explicitly configured otherwise.
	•	Event-Driven: Uses event streams to synchronize editor state, context updates, and triggers.
	•	Security by Design: End-to-end encryption, ephemeral storage, user-level access control.
	•	Zero-Duplication: Plugins coordinate to avoid overlapping functionality.

✨ Core Feature Implementations (High-Level)




1. Cognitive Context Mirror (CCM)




Context Agents:
	•	File: File system events captured via watchdog (Python) or chokidar (Node.js).
	•	Terminal: Hook into shell via a pseudoterminal wrapper or Zsh/Fish/Bash plugin.
	•	IDE Activity: Captured via VSCode/Neovim plugin RPC events.
	•	Browser Tabs: Chrome Extension sends tab metadata (domain, title, timestamp).




Storage:
	•	Schema: PostgreSQL w/ TimescaleDB hypertables for each agent.
	•	Example Table: context_events (id, agent, type, payload, timestamp)
	•	Performance: Redis used as local ring-buffer cache to prevent DB flooding.




Encryption:
	•	Vault microservice (Python) handles AES-256-GCM key generation, rotation, and usage.
	•	Uses libsodium with authenticated encryption.

2. AI Prompt Generator




Trigger Logic:
	•	Triggers on stuck-state signals (looping file edits, repeated errors, idle + test fails).
	•	Stuck state monitored via context graph delta patterns.




Prompt Assembly:
	•	Pulls last 30–60 minutes of context.
	•	Merges into Markdown+code with cursor location, recent terminal commands, error traces.
	•	Uses a templating system with semantic slot fill (e.g. ${last_error}).




API Adapter:
	•	Supports OpenAI, Claude, or local Ollama (via REST proxy).

3. Auto Commit Writer




Detection:
	•	Commit trigger via test_passed + context_stabilized events.




Message Template:
	•	Analyzed diffs + last error/test
	•	Adds related issue tag if pattern matches Jira ID or // ticket:PROJ-123
	•	Example:




Fix token expiry check in auth.js | Adds regression test | Context: jwt, auth | Relates to PROJ-123












GIT Hook:
	•	GitPython writes commit from background daemon
	•	Auto-stage optional (configurable)




⸻




4. Flow Orchestrator




Detection:
	•	Keystroke rhythm via keylogger API (non-invasive)
	•	Plugin activity via editor plugin events (onSave, onTest, onRun)
	•	Terminal engagement duration




Actions:
	•	Auto snoozes notifications (Slack API, OS DND)
	•	Logs flow session durations to TimescaleDB
	•	Syncs with calendar via Google Calendar API (optional)




⸻




5. Energy Scorer




Data Source:
	•	Flow time, test pass rate, context switches (file/tab/task), error frequency.




Computation:
	•	Python job runs hourly to compute and store score per developer per session.




Visualization:
	•	Dashboard in Tauri UI reads from TimescaleDB view.




⸻




6. Merge Conflict Resolver




Trigger:
	•	Git merge conflict detected via Git hook or plugin




Resolution Engine:
	•	AST diffing via tree-sitter
	•	Compares base vs incoming vs local context
	•	Pulls relevant recent context from CCM for explanations
	•	Generates proposed merge result w/ inline comments




⸻




7. Intent Drift Detector




Vector Embedding Engine:
	•	Use OpenAI/Instructor API or local sentence-transformers to embed:
	•	Original task title/description
	•	Recent commit messages




Logic:
	•	Drift if cosine similarity < 0.7
	•	Triggers alert: “Your last 3 commits may not align with your goal”




⸻




8. Auto Branch Suggestion




Trigger:
	•	New test or file activity with no active branch




Suggestion Logic:
	•	Parse closest TODO comment or recent Jira/PR ID
	•	Suggest: feature/auth-expiry-fix or proj-128/add-validation




Automation:
	•	GitPython auto-creates and checks out branch unless declined.




⸻




9. Pulse Points Engine




Scoring Metrics:
	•	Test written, bugs fixed, time in flow, helpful commits, PRs reviewed
	•	Losses for: reverted commits, stale branches, low coverage code




Storage:
	•	Redis for leaderboard, TimescaleDB for historical charts




UI:
	•	Pulse XP chart, streak tracker, and badge notifications in Tauri




⸻




10. Editor Plugins (VSCode + Neovim)




Shared Responsibilities:
	•	Track cursor movement, file saves, test commands
	•	Notify CCM of focus, test runs, code execution
	•	Allow command access: :PulseCommit, Pulse: Prompt Fix, etc.




Sync Mechanism:
	•	Redis pub/sub: current active plugin broadcasts status:active
	•	All others idle and defer event emission




State Sync:
	•	Shared session ID synced via IPC or Redis
	•	Persistent editor state is saved to context DB under that session




⸻




11. Security & Consent Gateway




Opt-in by Component:
	•	config.json or .pulseconfig defines enabled agents




Redaction Layer:
	•	Regex rules for secret scanning (API keys, tokens, passwords)




Wipe Modes:
	•	Auto-expire after 24h unless pinned
	•	Manual purge via Pulse:WipeContext command

With this blueprint, PulseDev+ can be implemented cleanly, securely, and in a modular way that scales from solo developers to engineering teams. Next steps: implement feature scaffolds and design inter-package RPC/API contracts.
🧩 Editor Plugin Ecosystem

🧠 Editor Awareness Layer
	•	VSCode Plugin (apps/vscode-plugin/)
	•	Neovim Plugin (apps/nvim-plugin/)
	•	Desktop App (Tauri/Electron)

All apps share the same Redis + PostgreSQL state and coordinate via IPC:
	•	Only one app/plugin is active at a time (the one in focus)
	•	Others go idle to prevent duplicate context ingestion
	•	All context and features are in sync across editors

Example: you switch from Neovim to VSCode → context session picks up seamlessly, history is preserved, and only one set of context agents run.
